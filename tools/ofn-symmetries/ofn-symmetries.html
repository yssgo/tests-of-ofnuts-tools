<h1>ofn-symmetries</h1>

<p>This plugin creates three symmetries of a layer. They are available in the menu <em>Layer ➤ Symmetries</em>.</p>

<p>Each symmetry has its own menu entry (instead of using a dialog to select options) so it can be 
assigned to its own keyboard shortcut.</p>

<h2>Straight symmetry</h2>

<p>This symmetry folds a layer along one of its medians. The name of the symmetry is the name of
the side which is kept and replicated. </p>

<h2>Diagonal symmetry</h2>

<p>This symmetry folds a square layer along one of its diagonals. The name of the symmetry is the name of
the corner which is kept and replicated. The filter only operates on square layers. </p>

<h2>Quadrilateral symmetry</h2>

<p>This symmetry copies and rotates the layer by multiples of 90°, and the resulting copies are
joined around a corner. The layer may not be square.</p>

<h3>Warnings</h3>

<ul>
<li>This symmetry assumes:
<ul>
<li>that the layer is the only one in the image</li>
<li>that the top left corner of the layer is in the top left corner of the image</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The image canvas is resized to fit the created layer. </li>
<li>Each execution of this symmetry creates an image that contains 4 times more pixels than its source, 
so memory usage will grow fast. Start with small images!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical usage</h2>

<p>Take any image, and:</p>

<ul>
<li>crop a square</li>
<li>scale it down to 200-300px</li>
<li>apply a diagonal symmetry once</li>
<li>apply the quadrilateral symmetry a couple of times</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The source image (the corner used (SW) is highlighted):</p>

<p><img src="ofn-symmetries-source.jpg" alt="source" title="" /></p>

<p>The final image after one diagonal and two quadrilateral symmetries (scaled down):</p>

<p><img src="ofn-symmetries-result.jpg" alt="result" title="" /></p>
